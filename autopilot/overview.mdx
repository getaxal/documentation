## Autopilot

Axal's flagship product, Autopilot, is your personal trading agent that executes complex, multi-step cryptocurrency trading strategies automatically.
Users can set up parameters to automate rebalancing, yield harvest, create a novel index of tokens they want to invest in, and more. 

For example, a user could create an index of memecoins (including tokens across different chains) and set up a parameter that says 
“the second it dips below 80% of the deposited amount, the agent (solver) sells everything and moves it to my centralized wallet.” 

Start your agent trading journey at [autopilot.getaxal.com](https://autopilot.getaxal.com).
