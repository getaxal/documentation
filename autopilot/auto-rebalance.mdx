Auto rebalancing automatically maintains your desired asset allocation by periodically adjusting your portfolio.
This feature helps you stay aligned with your investment strategy without manual intervention.

## How it works

Ways to rebalance:
* **Periodic Rebalancing**: Your portfolio automatically rebalances every few months to match your target allocation across different crypto indexes
* **Portfolio Size Triggers**: Additional rebalancing occurs when your portfolio reaches certain value thresholds

Additionally, rebalancing trades are executed with consideration for market conditions to optimize for better prices.

## Benefits
* Helps you maintain your risk exposure
* Removes emotional decision-making from the investment process
* Helps capture gains from high-performing assets while securing value in more stable ones
